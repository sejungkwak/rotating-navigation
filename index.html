            <h1 class="title">12 Rules for Life: an antidote to chaos</h1>
            <h3 class="subtitle">by Jordan Peterson</h3>
            <p class="introduction"><strong>What are the most valuable things that everyone should know?</strong><br >
                In this book, Jordan Peterson provides twelve profound and practical principles for how to live a meaningful life, 
                from setting your house in order before criticizing others to comparing yourself to who you were yesterday, not someone else today. 
                Happiness is a pointless goal, he shows us. Instead we must search for meaning, not for its own sake, 
                but as a defence against the suffering that is intrinsic to our existence.
            </p>

            <figcaption class="extract">You need to consider the future and think, 
                "What might my life look like if I were caring for myself properly? What career would challenge me and render me productive and helpful, 
                so that I could shoulder my share of the load, and enjoy the consequences? What should I be doing, when I have some freedom, 
                to improve my health, expand my knowledge, and strengthen my body?" You need to know where you are, so you can start to chart your course. <br />
